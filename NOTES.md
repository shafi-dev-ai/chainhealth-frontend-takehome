Time spent: ~3.5 hours

Assumptions:
- The API server is running locally with the provided mock data and pagination format.
- CSS-based charts are acceptable for the data visualization requirement.

Improvements with more time:
- Add richer charting for trends across nodes, staking, and records.
- Add deep linking for record, staker, and transaction detail views.
- Expand responsive navigation for small screens.

Challenges:
- Coordinating multiple API feeds per page while keeping loading states clear.
